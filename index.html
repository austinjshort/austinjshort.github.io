<p>This is an example of a Progressive Web Application or PWA. PWAs are applications that are built and served over
    the web using HTML, Javascript, and CSS rather than traditional native apps that utilize languages such as Java or
    Python. PWAs have several mechanisms that are used to bridge the gap in performance between an ordinary browser page
    versus a native app.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>The main techniques that allow PWAs to be made are Web Caching and Service Workers. Web caching, also referred to
    as local storage allows for a large amount of data (approximately 5 MB) to be stored locally reducing the processing time
    to request and load assets and pages. These assets are cached and checked by Service workers which are network proxies
    that cant check server availability and cache content when it becomes available. All these features are mapped into the
    manifest. The Manifest is a JSON file that contains the metadata for the application. It specifies what the app contains
    and what the scope, contents, and offline content are available for the app.</p>
