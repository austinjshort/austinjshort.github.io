<h2 id="reactHead" class = hidden>React Native</h2>
<p id="reactBody" class = hidden>Is an open source framework maintained by Facebook. The framework has been around since 2015 and has a large user
  base behind it and is very stable. It is built upon javascript and therefore is the most straight forward option for
  new developers. Furthermore any portion of an application that you want to port to a web page is easily transferred
  over directly. It is also the platform with the most developers and job opportunities associated with it.</p>

<h2 id="flutterHead" class = hidden>Flutter</h2>
<p id="flutterBody" class = hidden >Is a free open source development kit that is maintained by Google. Flutter utilizes the DART language that allows
  it to natively compile applications for iOS, android, web, and desktop from a single code base. One potential downside
  is that the development is specialized towards android and heavily leans on Android Studio for development. The main
  appeal for Flutter is that it is build upon a large library of widgets out of the box. </p>

<h2 id="phonegapHead" class = hidden >PhoneGap</h2>
<p id="phonegapBody" class = hidden >PhoneGap is effectively an implementation of Cordova, and open source software, with some additional items
  provided by the Adobe corporation. The software has been discontinued as of late 2020.</p>

<h2 id="cordovaHead" class = hidden>Cordova</h2>
<p id="cordovaBody" class = hidden>Cordova is the only truly open source framework as it is maintained under Apache license.
  Cordova allows for native execution of Javascript/HTML/CSS. Thanks to its open source status, there are several plugins
  available. One downside is having to have different development environments for each
  platform you seek to develop on. It is slower than other frameworks as well. </p>
