        <p class="p1">My name is Austin Short, northern California native. I currently work in the Regulatory
        department for a SaaS company that develops software for life science industries. I've been
        taking courses in Computer Science at the College of San Mateo for a few years and this
        semester will be my last before finishing my Associates degree.
        </p>

    <p>I'm taking this class to learn how the company I work for does what they do and I'm interested
        in general about how web development and apps can be used to help make tools that can
        better our lives.
